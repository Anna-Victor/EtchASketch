This project involves the creation of a grid of boxes. It works in such a way that there is a prompt for the user to enter the number of grids they want and the grid is then displayed on the screen as a clean work sheet.

The code has been predorminantly written in Javascript though CSS and HTML have also been actively used in the project.
